Berlin nightlife can be very frustating sometimes with all the queues and waiting, so why not? [QueueSpy](https://queue-spy-project.firebaseapp.com)

> Disorientating, mind blowing, brutal, fun, surprising, longlasting and freaky, Berlin is probably the best clubbing city in Europe. The clubber culture has become a life style and music is a religion. You may wonder why the nightlife is so intense in this city. Berlin's transformation into the world techno capital is very much linked to the German reunification and the fall of the Berlin Wall. As the wall came down, so did all the previous patterns of behaviour. People were taking advantage of their recently acquired freedom, which is why the clubbing scene developed in such a unique way and over such a short period of time. Inside abandoned factories and commercial buildings that had to be taken down, clubs started to mushroom at full speed. Looking to express themselves, Berliners found inside those clubs a new identity. Since there are so many options in town, we will give you an insider guide about the 10 best clubs to make sure you don’t get lost in this hedonistic Disneyland for grown ups. So pay attention to every single detail and viel Spaß!
